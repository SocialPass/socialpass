## User story
(Example: As an administrator, I want to see the events from a user. Because when I'm speaking with the users, I want to know what he has in their account.)

## What should be done
[ ] Add a new page to the admin panel
[ ] Add a list of user in this page
[ ] Make each user clickable
[ ] On click, redirect to a new page with the events of the user
[ ] Only admins should be able to access these pages

## Specifications · Mockups · Screen design
(If specifications and screen designs already exist, describe their URL. Figma, Design doc, Miro, etc.)

## Expected output
[ ] e.g. User list should be at URL: https://example.com/backoffice/users
[ ] e.g. User Events should be at URL: https://example.com/backoffice/users/<user_id>

## What should be tested
[ ] e.g. User without Admin Access must receive a Forbidden message
